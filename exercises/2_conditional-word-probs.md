# If-Else Statements
Instructions:  
Write code to solve these problems. Do as many of these problems as you can in the time allotted.

1. Prompt for a number.  If the number is greater than 70, print PASSING; otherwise, print NOT PASSING.

2. Prompt for a string.  If the string is equal to "green", print GO, otherwise, print STOP.

3. Prompt for a number.  If the number is even, print EVEN, otherwise, print ODD.

4. Prompt for a number.  If the number is evenly divisible by 5, print MULTIPLE OF 5, otherwise, print NOT A MULTIPLE OF 5.

5. Prompt for a number.  If the number is less than 10, print ONE DIGIT. If the number is 100 or greater, print THREE DIGITS, otherwise print TWO DIGITS.

6. Prompt for a jersey number. If that number is 12, 71, or 80, print "That number is retired from the Seattle Seahawks!", otherwise do nothing.

7. Prompt for a state. If the state is Washington, Oregon, or Idaho, print "This state is in the PNW", otherwise print "You should move to the PNW; it’s great here!"

8. Prompt for a one of the following: SHORT, TALL, GRANDE, VENTI. Print out the number of ounces that drink includes (8, 12, 16, 20 respectively).

9. Prompt for rate of pay and hours worked.  Calculate gross pay.  Provide 'time and a half' for hours worked beyond 40.  i.e. If you get paid $10/hr and work 45 hours in a week, you would gross 40x10 + 5x15 = $745  

10. **Harder—Completing this problem will require a slight rewrite to #9 so that it’s code can be reused instead of rewritten for #10.**
 Prompt for rate of pay and hours worked.  Calculate gross pay if the hours are 40 or less.  Provide ‘time and a half’ for hours worked beyond 40.  Do not process any employee if their hours worked is greater than 60, instead display the message “Please see manager.”
