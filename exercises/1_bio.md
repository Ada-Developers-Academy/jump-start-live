# Exercise: Bios!

## Instructions
1. Create a program that accepts input from the user and outputs a bio with that information
2. Use up to five different attributes about the person to populate the bio
3. Output should consist of a paragraph of output that has the user's input substituted in.

## Example
```
Name: Viola Davis
Birthday: August 11th, 1980
Occupation: Actress
```

```
Viola Davis is an actress who is 50 years old. Her birthday is on August 11th. She is a(n) actress.
```

Note: This example is a bit more challenging since we decided to calculate a few things to display in the output.


## Added Fun!
Use the attributes provided to do some calculations to make your bio a bit more interesting.
