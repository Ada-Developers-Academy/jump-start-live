# Loop Problems

Instructions:  
Choose a partner with whom you will split these exercises. You will work on one problem and your partner will work through the other. First, try to complete these problems on paper. Then, if you have time, try to do this in code.

1. Write a program that allows a user to play a guessing number game. You should predetermine the secret number (between 0-1000). Allow the user to make a guess until she guesses the answer. After each guess you should print "higher" or "lower".

2. Write a program that allows the user to enter the number of players in a game of eenie meenie minee moe. Then, one by one, print `tapping player #1: eenie`, `tapping player #2: meenie`, `tapping player #3: minee`, `tapping player #: moe`.
