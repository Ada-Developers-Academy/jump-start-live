# Assignment: Make a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich
For this activity, you will write precise instructions to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. You will need to find a friend to carry out those instructions to test your algorithm's clarity. The one giving instructions (you) cannot touch the ingredients or tools, and the one receiving instructions (your friend) cannot speak back.

### For the Instruction Giver
When listing the steps in your procedure, you should assume the person following your instructions is as straightforward as a computer (they do not make assumptions or ask for clarity).

### For the Instruction Receiver
When following the instructions, interpret them as literally as possible. Messes are acceptable (even expected!)

## Assumptions
While a computer has no "common sense" that would allow it to correctly guess your intent, we can assume a certain knowledge of these basic actions:

- open any container
- close any container
- hold a thing
- pick up a thing
- put a thing down
- spread a condiment

What we're missing is timing, amounts, and other interactive qualities. For example, we can say "spread the jelly" and assume the Receiver knows how to work their muscles, but will continue to "spread the jelly" all over everything within arms reach unless or until given a condition to cease.

## Primary Requirements
- Write instructions to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich (or alternate if you have allergies :-) )
- Give the instructions to a friend and watch them complete your task without any further information from you
- If your algorithm "breaks" (messiness, inedible, etc), try and modify your algorithm and test on a new friend until you get the desired output you are looking for
