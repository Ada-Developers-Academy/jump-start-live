# Assignment: Make a Paper Snowflake
For this activity, you will write precise instructions to make a paper snowflake. You will need to find a friend to carry out those instructions to test your algorithm's clarity. The one giving instructions (you) cannot touch the ingredients or tools, and the one receiving instructions (your friend) cannot speak back.

### For the Instruction Giver
When listing the steps in your procedure, you should assume the person following your instructions is as straightforward as a computer (they do not make assumptions or ask for clarity).

### For the Instruction Receiver
When following the instructions, interpret them as literally as possible. Messes are acceptable (even expected!)

## Assumptions
While a computer has no "common sense" that would allow it to correctly guess your intent, we can assume a certain knowledge of these basic actions:

- cut a straight line
- cut a circle, triangle, square
- measurements in inches

What we're missing is timing, amounts, and other interactive qualities. For example, we can say "cut a triangle" and assume the Receiver knows how to work their muscles, but may cut the triangle larger or smaller than you intended without measurements.

## Primary Requirements
- Make a paper snowflake yourself
- Write instructions to recreate your paper snowflake
- Give the instructions to a friend and watch them complete your task without any further information from you
- If your algorithm "breaks" (their snowflake does NOT look like your snowflake, etc), try and modify your algorithm and test on a new friend until you get the desired output you are looking for
