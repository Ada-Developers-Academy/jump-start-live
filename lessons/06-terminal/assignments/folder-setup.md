# Folder Setup

When you are writing code, it is good to have a folder structure which is logical to you so you can quickly find code and files you are looking for.

1. Create a new folder called "ada" inside of your _home directory_ to store Ada-related folders and files. Once the folder is created, switch into that new folder:    
```bash
cd ~
mkdir ada
cd ada
```
1. Create a new folder called "jumpstart" which will store all folders and files related to this Jumpstart work. Once the folder is created, switch into that new folder:  
```bash
mkdir jumpstart
cd jumpstart
```
1. Verify that the folder structure was created appropriately by running the `pwd` command. The output should include your username and end with `/ada/jumpstart`.
