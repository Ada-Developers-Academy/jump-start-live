## Assignment Statements

Understanding how to read and use assignment statements is a critical skill in programming

### Reading Assignment Statements
* Assignment statements are read from right-to-left, not from left-to-right
* Use phrases like _assigns_, or _stores the value_, instead of _equals_, or _equal to_

```ruby
# the value of 5 is assigned to the variable named x
x = 5
# the current value of x(5) is added with 1
# that sum is then assigned to the variable named x
x = x + 1
```

```ruby
# the value of 1 is assigned to the variable named x
x = 1
# the value stored in x(1) is assigned to y
# note: this does not mean that x and y will always
# store the same value
y = x
```

### Exercises
1. What is the value of x, after the following code is executed?

	```ruby
	x = 2
	x = x + 3
	x = x * 2
	```

2. What are the values of x, and y, after the following code is executed?

	```ruby
	x = 3
	y = x
	x = x + 7
	y = -1
	```
