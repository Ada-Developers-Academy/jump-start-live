# Day 2

## Prep Work
* Review your [Candy Machine](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/jump-start/blob/master/lessons/10-programming-expressions/assignments/candy-machine.md) solution and be prepared to talk with others about your code
* Review the [Conditional notes](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/jump-start/blob/master/lessons/10-programming-expressions/notes/conditionals.md) from Jumpstart
* Review the [Operators notes](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/jump-start/blob/master/lessons/10-programming-expressions/notes/operators.md) from Jumpstart

## Goals
* Understand order of operations
* Understand and be able to use relational and logical operators
* Understand and be able to write boolean expressions
* Understand and be able to write conditional statements

## Warm up
* Share what you learned from our last session about coding style
* Walk your partner though your Candy machine code focusing on using programming vocabulary (e.g, conditional statements, variable assignment, relational operators, logical operators, expressions)

## Lessons
* [Boolean Expressions](boolean-expressions.md)
* [Conditionals](conditionals.md)

## Exercises
1. In one Ruby file, write code to solve the problems below. Your code should print out each problem statement first, followed by the conditional statement(s).

	1. Prompt for a number. If the number is greater than 70, print PASSING; otherwise, print NOT PASSING.    
	1. Prompt for a string.  If the string is equal to "green", print GO, otherwise, print STOP.
	1. Prompt for a number.  If the number is even, print EVEN, otherwise, print ODD.
	1. Prompt for a number. If the number is evenly divisible by 5, print MULTIPLE OF 5, otherwise, print NOT A MULTIPLE OF 5.    
	1. Prompt for a number. If the number is less than 10, print ONE DIGIT. If the number is 100 or greater, print THREE DIGITS, otherwise print TWO DIGITS.
	1. Prompt for a jersey number. If that number is 12, 71, or 80, print “That number is retired from the Seattle Seahawks!”, otherwise do nothing.
	1. Prompt for a state. If the state is Washington, Oregon, or Idaho, print “This state is in the PNW”, otherwise print “You should move to the PNW; it’s great here!”
	1. Prompt for a one of the following: SHORT, TALL, GRANDE, VENTI. Print out the number of ounces that drink includes (8, 12, 16, 20 respectively). 
	1. Prompt for rate of pay and hours worked. Calculate gross pay. Provide ‘time and a half’ for hours worked beyond 40  (e.g., if you get paid $10/hr and work 45 hours in a week, you would gross $745 (40x10 + 5x15).
	1. Rewrite the solution to the previous problem adding this modification: do not process any employee if their hours worked is greater than 60, instead display the message “Please see manager.” 

## Debrief
* What new things did you learn today?
* What topics are you still struggling with?
* What did you especially enjoy about today's class?
* What can be improved for future classes?

## Homework
* Review your [Election time](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/jump-start/blob/master/lessons/10-programming-expressions/assignments/candy-machine.md) solution and be prepared to talk with others about your code
