# Day 2

## Prep Work
* Review your [Candy Machine](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/jump-start/tree/master/lessons/programming-expressions) solution and be prepared to talk with others about your code
* Review the [Conditional and operators notes](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/jump-start/tree/master/lessons/programming-expressions) from JumpStart
* Watch [Day 2 Videos](https://adaacademy.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?folderID=43637773-8776-4592-977d-938f3fac6ef2) and review [lesson notes](#lessons).
* Complete [exercises](#exercises) listed below and be prepared to discuss them with others in class.

## Goals
* Understand order of operations
* Understand and be able to use relational and logical operators
* Understand and be able to write boolean expressions
* Understand and be able to write conditional statements

## Warm up
* Share what you learned from our last session about coding style
* Walk your partner though your Candy machine code focusing on using programming vocabulary (e.g, conditional statements, variable assignment, relational operators, logical operators, expressions)

## Lessons
* [Assignment Statements](assignment_statements.md)
* [Boolean Expressions](boolean_expressions.md)
* [Conditionals](conditionals.md)

## Exercises
_In one Ruby file, write code to solve the problems below. Your code should print out each problem statement, followed by the output from the conditional statement(s)._

1. Prompt for a number. If the number is greater than `70`, print `PASSING`; otherwise, print `NOT PASSING`.    
2. Prompt for a string.  If the string is equal to `green`, print `GO`, otherwise, print `STOP`.
3. Prompt for a number.  If the number is even, print `EVEN`, otherwise, print `ODD`.
4. Prompt for a number. If the number is evenly divisible by `5`, print `MULTIPLE OF 5`, otherwise, print `NOT A MULTIPLE OF 5`.    
5. Prompt for a number. If the number is less than `10`, print `ONE DIGIT`. If the number is `100` or greater, print `THREE DIGITS`, otherwise print `TWO DIGITS`.
6. Prompt for a jersey number. If that number is `12`, `71`, or `80`, print `That number is retired from the Seattle Seahawks!`, otherwise do nothing.
7. Prompt for a state. If the state is `Washington`, `Oregon`, or `Idaho`, print `This state is in the PNW`, otherwise print `You should move to the PNW; itâ€™s great here!`
8. Prompt for a one of the following: `SHORT`, `TALL`, `GRANDE`, `VENTI`. Print out the number of ounces that drink includes (`8`, `12`, `16`, `20` respectively).
9. Prompt for rate of pay and hours worked. Calculate gross pay. Provide time-and-a-half for hours worked beyond `40`  (e.g., if you get paid $10/hr and work 45 hours in a week, you would gross $475 (`40 x 10 + 5 x 15`).
10. Rewrite the solution to the previous problem adding this modification: do not process any employee if their hours worked is greater than `60`, instead display the message `Please see manager`.

## Debrief
* What new things did you learn today?
