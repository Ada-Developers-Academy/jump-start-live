# Day 4

## Prep Work
* Review the [Iterator notes](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/jump-start/tree/master/lessons/11-iterators/notes) from Jumpstart
* Finish all exercises from [Day 3's class](../day3)

### Warm up
* Walk your partner through one of the loop exercises you completed last class

### Lessons
* [Loops](../day3/loops.md)

### Exercise
1. Password Verification

  Many companies have password requirements (must include a letter, a number and a symbol for example and require a password of a specific length). We're going to write a program that will read in a proposed password and only accept it, if it meets all rules.  

  Create a program that will: 

  * Prompt a user for input (for a new password)
  * Read in the proposed Password to a variable
  * If the password contains a number and a symbol (@, %, *, or !) and contains 8 or more characters then accept the password and congratulate the user, if not make them reenter the password until they enter an acceptable password.
  
  __Optional Additions__
  * Make the user enter the password a second time to verify, and if it's not the same as the original password, make them repeat the process.
  * Make them include a capital and a lowercase letter
  * Let them know what they did wrong.

### Debrief
* What new things did you learn today?
* What topics are you still struggling with?
* What did you especially enjoy about today's class?
* What can be improved for future classes?

### Homework
* Review your [Student Account Generator](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/jump-start/blob/master/lessons/12-basic-data-structs/assignments/account-generator.md) solution and be prepared to talk with others about your code
* Review the [Array notes](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/jump-start/blob/master/lessons/12-basic-data-structs/notes/arrays.md) from Jumpstart
