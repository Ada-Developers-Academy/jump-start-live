## Exercise
1. Password Verification

		Many companies have password requirements (must include a letter, a number and a symbol for example and require a password of a specific length). We're going to write a program that will read in a proposed password and only accept it, if it meets all rules.  

		Create a program that will:
		* Prompt a user for input (for a new password)
		* Read in the proposed Password to a variable
		* If the password contains a number and a symbol (@, %, \*, or !) and contains 8 or more characters then accept the password and congratulate the user, if not make them reenter the password until they enter an acceptable password
		* [Optional] Make the user enter the password a second time to verify, and if it's not the same as the original password, make them repeat the process
		* [Optional] Make them include a capital and a lowercase letter
		* [Optional] Let them know what they did wrong
