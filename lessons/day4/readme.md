### Exercise
# Password Verification

Many companies have password requirements (must include a letter, a number and a symbol for example and require a password of a specific length). We're going to write a program that will readin a proposed password and only accept it, if it meets all other expectations.  

Instructions
-----------
Create a program that will: 

  - Prompt a user for input (for a new password)
  - Read in the proposed Password to a variable
  - If the password contains a:
    * number
    * symbol (@, %, *, or !)
    * and has a length greater than 7 (8 or more characters)
  - Then accept the password and congratulate the user, if not make them reenter the password until they enter an acceptable password.
  
Extensions
==========
  -  Make the user enter the password a second time to verify, and if it's not the same as the original password, make them repeat the process.
  -  Make them include a capital and a lowercase letter
  -  Let them know what they did wrong.

### Debrief
* Reviewing the exercises and pain points
