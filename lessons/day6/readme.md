_Jumpstart Live (JSL)_
# Day 6

## Prep Work
* Review your [Student Account Generator Part 2](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/jump-start/blob/master/lessons/12-basic-data-structs/assignments/account-generator-cont.md) solution and be prepared to talk with others about your code
* Review the [Hashes notes](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/jump-start/blob/master/lessons/12-basic-data-structs/notes/hashes.md) from Jumpstart

## Warm up
* Share what you learned from our last session on arrays
* Walk your partner though your Student Account Generator Part 1 code focusing on using programming vocabulary (e.g, hashes, key, value, blocks, loops, iterator, variable assignment)

## Lessons
* [Symbols](symbols.md)
* [Array and Hashes Comparison](arrays_vs_hashes.md)
* [Hashes](hashes.md)

## Exercise
1. Ask the user to enter the names, ages, and favorite colors of their closest friends (you may assume that the user's close friends all have unique names). Store the entered user information into a hash. Output the total number of close friends under 18, followed by their names. Output the number of unique favorite colors, and then list them.

	### Sample Log

	```
	Welcome to Hash Fun.
	I will be asking you for the names, ages, and favorite colors of your closest friends.
	How many close friends do you have? 2
	What is friend #1s name? Riley
	What is friend #1s age? 37
	What is friend #1s favorite color? Gray
	What is friend #2s name? Amanze
	What is friend #2s age? 16
	What is friend #2s favorite color? Blue

	You have 1 close friend under 18 [Amanze].
	Your friends have 2 unique favorite colors [Gray, Blue].
	```

## Debrief
* How do you determine whether it is best to use an array or a hash?
* How can we further support you before the first day of Ada class?
* What did you especially enjoy about Jumpstart Live?
* What can be improved for future offerings of Jumpstart Live?

## Homework
* Relax, and enjoy your week before the start of Ada
