# Day 6

### Warm up
* Discuss student account generator code part 2

### Discussion
* Recap arrays from previous lesson
* Review storing and retrieving data from a hash
* Review iterating over a hash
* Discuss differences between Array and Hash and usages for one over the other

### Exercise
# Using Hashes

## Instructions:  
Choose a partner with whom you will split these exercises. You will work on one problem and your partner will work through the other. First, try to complete these problems on paper. Then, if you have time, try to do this in code.

1. Create a hash which will allow us to look up what state a city is in. Ex: For input "Seattle", output should be "WA".  
  a. Include at least 4 cities in your hash  
  b. How might you access _only_ the **keys** of your hash?  

2. Create a hash which will allow us to look up a person's name using their last name. Ex: For input "Lovelace", output should be "Ada Lovelace".  
  a. Include at least 4 names in your hash  
  b. How might you access _only_ the **values** of your hash?
