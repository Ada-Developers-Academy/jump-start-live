# Jumpstart Live (JSL)

We launched Ada Jumpstart in January 2016 to better support the truly beginner coders that we have admitted into Ada Developers Academy. We know that all our students are joining Ada to learn to program and become software developers, but everyone comes to us from different backgrounds and different prior experience with coding. We know that different people need different support systems to be successful and this support system is directed at our Adies who are newest to the coding world.

You can see out public, online, open source curriculum: [Jumpstart](https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/jump-start). We have structured this curriculum to help anyone launch a career into coding. We do expect that all incoming students complete all the assignments in Jumpstart.

The material in this repo, "Jumpstart Live", is a companion to the online Jumpstart material. This onsite structured time will occur for the 3 weeks prior to Ada. During this time we will host 2-hour “project time” sessions 2 times a week for new coders to come get help/reinforcement on the curriculum concepts. No new material will be covered during the project time, but we want to give newer coders the ability to get extra support in completing the assignments and practicing the concepts.

We ask that more experienced coders leave this space for our newest to code students. We will provide some guidelines below for self-selecting into Jumpstart Live, but also reserve the right to concentrate our support during this project time on the students that need it the most. If you would like to attend Jumpstart Live but think that evenings in Seattle the 3 weeks before class would not work for you (transplant, work, etc), please let us know so we can something out.
