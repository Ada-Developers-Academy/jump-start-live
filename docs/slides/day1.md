# Peer code review: Candy Machine

Pointers for code review:
* Ruby style guides: snake_case, spaces, comments, indentation

* Are all minimal requirements followed and working?

* Are any additional, optional requirements coded and working?

* User experience
    * Are the prompts useful, educational, and sufficient for the user of the
      program who is unaware of the requirements?

    * What is the user enters information in an incorrect format? (case
      insensitive input, detailed error messages, prompt for re-entry)

P.S: for easier code reviews, save files with `.rb` extensions in your gists.
This allows for better formatting. Saving multiple `.rb` files helps scope the
feedback and test code as you make changes.
